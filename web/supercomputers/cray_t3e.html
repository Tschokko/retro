  <H1>Cray T3E massively parallel supercomputers</H1>
  <H2>TL;DR</H2><A HREF="#overview">Jump to System Overview</A>
  <P>The Cray T3E is the successor of our <A HREF="cray_t3d.html">Cray T3D</A>
  and is a massively parallel supercomputer, launched in 1995. In contrast to
  our Cray T3D, we own a Cray T3E in a multi-cabinet air-cooled configuration
  with up to 128 processing elements. Therefore it's a perfect supercomputer to
  run and operate frequently without too complex infrastructure requirements,
  except the high power consumption.</P>
  <P>Since we have a bunch of cabinets we can even run two Cray T3E
  installations! A small configuration with an acceptable power footprint for
  regular operation, and a maximum configuration with 128 processors and 16
  GBytes of main memory, of course.</P>
  <P>The development of massively parallel supercomputers started very early at
  Cray. Together with DEC they launched a project called Piranha and the first
  results where named Wildfire and Marvel. That's why we named our two
  supercomputers wildfire and marvel, too.</P>
  <P>If you're interessted in more details about the Cray T3E have a look at
  <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray_T3E">Wikipedia</A>.</P>

  <H3><A NAME="wildfire">wildfire.gigaflops.net</A></H3>
  <P>This supercomputer should be used as a primary development system for
  massively parallel workloads. It consists of two cabinets with 32 processing
  elements total. If your code is working fine you can request a schedule for
  the large 128 PEs configuration.</P>
  <H3><A NAME="marvel">marvel.gigaflops.net</A></H3>
  <P>This supercomputer is the largest possible configuration of an air-cooled
  Cray T3E. It consists of 6 cabinets and 128 processing elements total, with a
  peak performance of 80.0 GigaFLOPS.</P><A HREF=

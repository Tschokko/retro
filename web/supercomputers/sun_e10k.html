  <H1>Sun Ultra Enterprise 10000 symmetric multiprocessing system</H1>
  <H2>TL;DR</H2><A HREF="#overview">Jump to System Overview</A>
  <P>During the dot-com boom period the Sun Ultra Enterprise 10000 (also known
  as E10k) was one of the most popular supercomputers of the world. It's the
  successor of the <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray_CS6400">Cray
  Superserver 6400</A>, but Cray Research was acquired by Silicon Graphics and
  this division of supercomputers was than sold to Sun. Sun launched the
  successor, code-name Starfire, as the Ultra Enterprise 10000 in 1997.</P>
  <P>This supercomputer is in contrast to the usual supercomputers by Cray a
  general-purpose system. Beside typical high-performance computing tasks, this
  system was often used as an application or database server, too. The
  partitioning feature of the Sun Ultra Enterprise 10000 enabled this system
  even to be split into multiple logical servers for certain functions. Due
  it's versatile usage the Sun Ultra Enterprise 10000 was present in nearly
  every area, where lot's of universal computing power was required.</P>
  <P>Because of it's broad usage in several ares, this system is a must have
  supercomputer in every supercomputer collection.</P>
  <P>If your interessted in more information about the Sun Ultra Enterprise
  10000, have a look at <A HREF=

  <P>We splitted our Sun Ultra Enterprise into two partitions. During operating
  you have access to 56 processor and 56 GB of main memory.</P><A HREF=

  <H1>Welcome to gigaflops.org</H1>
  <P>This site is dedicated to vintage supercomputers, which delivered a
  measured computing power of multiple GigaFLOPS up to one TeraFLOP in the past
  days. Our mission is to repair, maintain and preseve these supercomputers for
  historic reasons. Our organisation currently owns a couple of such <A HREF=
  "supercomputers.html">supercomputers</A> and most of them are dated in the
  1990s, mainly Cray, SGI and SUN. During our operating times you can even
  access these systems and run your own workloads. Go to <A HREF=
  "login.html">login</A> and enjoy real a supercomputer from the past!</P>
